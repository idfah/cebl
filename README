The Colorado Electroencephalography and Brain-Computer Interfaces Laboratory (CEBL) is a software platform, written primarily in Python and C, that is designed to support all phases of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research and development.  CEBL is currently being developed by Elliott Forney and Charles Anderson at the Colorado State University BCI Laboratory and supports a variety of standard and cutting-edge features, including modules for signal processing, machine learning, visualization and a fully-functional Graphical User Interface (GUI).  A major design goal of CEBL is to allow researchers to rapidly progress novel ideas from the early offline experimental and analysis stages to fully functional real-time BCI systems.
